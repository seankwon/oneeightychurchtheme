      <h2>180 Core Values</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Gospel Driven:</strong>
          We believe the very foundation of our values is driven by the complete change found in Jesus Christ. This is where all our values and beliefs stand. 
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Transcending Culture:</strong>
          We believe that culture gives us a context of expectations and customs in how we relate to one another. Therefore, the gospel is not counter or anti-cultural, but rather transcultural. It's about creating Christ values within it and to represent Him well.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Spirit Filled:</strong>
          We believe in the person of the Holy Spirit and the charismatic gifts. The purpose of being Spirit-filled isn't for the sake of manifestation or the gift itself, but to be a witness and bear fruit!
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Community Based:</strong>
          No one is exempt from struggle. No matter who you are, where you are from or what you do, you will have a moment of crisis. That is what it means to be human. That is why we believe that no one is meant to live a life of faith on their own. We are brothers and sister who are in a journey of faith together.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Risk Taking:</strong>
          We are people who believe in the impossible. We are faith-filled people who are willing to risk everything for the sake of the advancement of the kingdom of God. That is what it means to be a follower of Christ.
        </li>
      </ol>

        Our main theological statement of faith is synonymous with the Lausanne Covenant that was engineered by the renowned theologian Dr. John Stott, along with Dr. Billy Graham (BGEA) and Dr. Leighton Ford (Arrow Leadership), which was drafted in 1974 at the first Lausanne Congress for world evangelization. To learn more about our statement of faith, see the Lausanne Covenant of Faith.
