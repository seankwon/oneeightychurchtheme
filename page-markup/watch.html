      <h2>Where's Jesus in Our Economic Identity</h2>
      <h5>Luke 18:15-17</h5>
      <p>In our society today, many of us are bound in a culture that attaches social status, net worth, and titles to our identities and self-worth. What we do and the achievements we have in our lives often determine the measure of our identities, but no matter how much we win at this game of life, the human spirit is often left dissatisfied - the longing to be loved echoes endlessly. The Christian journey is a tension of fighting between a world that says we need to do more and a voice that asks us to freely receive our identity as his beloved, in the fullness of undeserving grace and in child likeness.</p>
