      <p>Come to Sunday service! That's where the sermons happen, and then we eat afterwards.</p>
      <p><strong>Time:</strong> Service starts at 12 noon every Sunday.</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Location:</strong> Our service is in a movie theater by Union Square:
        <br>
        AMC Loews Theater
        <br>
        890 Broadway (@ 19th St)
        <br>
        New York, NY 10003
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>How to get there:</i>
        <br>
        Take the 4, 5, 6, N, R, or Q to Union Square, then walk up Broadway to 19th street.
        <br>
        Or if you prefer to drive, there is free street parking in the area on Sundays!
      </p>

      <p>If you're looking for more (say, around the middle of the week) or you just want to go deeper into the message, small groups can help with that.</p>
