        <h2>WHERE'S JESUS IN OUR POLITICAL POWER?</h2>
        <strong><a href='#verse'>Acts 4:1-17</a></strong>
        <p>
          Power in human hands always tends to corrupt. Whether acquired by birthright or through association, power always works the same - anyone who has it will put it to use. The New Testament, through a political lens, shares the story of ordinary, uneducated fishermen who begin a revolution by sharing what they've seen and heard.
