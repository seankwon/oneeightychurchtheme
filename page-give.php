        <p>
          We at 180 believe that financial integrity (traditionally, tithe) is a non-negotiable part of Christian discipleship. This means that we cannot grow spiritually apart from honoring God with our finances. We pray that we would all strive to make God our first priority and not our last resort in any area of our lives.
          <br>
          <br>
          However, sometimes we don't give to God not because we're evil or don't want to, but simply because we have the tendency to forget! This is precisely why we have created a way for all of us to give online.

        <h2>Malachi 3:10</h2>
        <p>"Bring the whole tithe into the storehouse, that there may be food in my house. Test me in this," says the LORD Almighty, "and see if I will not throw open the floodgates of heaven and pour out so much blessing that you will not have room enough for it."</p>
